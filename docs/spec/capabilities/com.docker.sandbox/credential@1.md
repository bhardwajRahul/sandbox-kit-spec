# `com.docker.sandbox/credential@1`

One service the workload authenticates to, and how the runtime presents
proof — never where the secret lives. The host's credential store is the
sole source; a Kit declares the need, the user's bindings answer it.

- **Shape**: instance — one entry per (service, phase); duplicates rejected.
- **Permission surface**: yes — the service name, per phase.

## Config

```yaml
- type: com.docker.sandbox/credential@1
  optional: true                       # entry-level: skip when unbound
  description: GitHub API access for gh
  config:
    service: github                    # REQUIRED: identifier in the host credential store
    phase: runtime                     # REQUIRED: "install" | "runtime"
    apiKey:                            # api-key presentation
      name: GH_TOKEN
      proxyManaged: true
      inject:
        - {domain: api.github.com, header: Authorization, format: "Bearer %s"}
        - {domain: github.com, scheme: basic, username: x-access-token}
    oauth:                             # OAuth presentation
      tokenEndpoint: {host: platform.claude.com, path: /v1/oauth/token}
      resourceHosts: [api.anthropic.com]
      sentinels:
        accessToken: sk-ant-oat01-proxy-managed
        refreshToken: sk-ant-ort01-proxy-managed
      credentialFile:
        path: ~/.claude/.credentials.json
        structure:
          claudeAiOauth:

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `service` | string | REQUIRED. Lowercase-kebab name in the host credential store. |
| `phase` | string | REQUIRED. `install` or `runtime`. |
| `apiKey` | object | conditional. At least one of `apiKey`/`oauth` MUST be declared. | <!-- tck: credential@1/one-of-apikey-oauth -->
| `apiKey.name` | string | In-container env var name. Empty or omitted with `inject` rules present declares an inject-only credential: outbound rewrites with no environment presence, not even a sentinel. At least one of `name`/`inject` MUST be declared. | <!-- tck: credential@1/name-or-inject -->
| `apiKey.proxyManaged` | bool | The real value stays on the host. A named key's variable carries a sentinel; an inject-only key has no in-container presence, and the boundary presents the real value outbound either way. |
| `apiKey.inject[]` | list | Outbound rewrite rules. `domain` REQUIRED and MUST appear in the network policy's matching-phase allow list, whether the Kit declares [`@1`](network-policy@1.md) or [`@2`](network-policy@2.md). | <!-- tck: credential@1/inject-domain-in-allow -->
| `apiKey.inject[].header` / `format` | string | Header to set; `format` renders the value (e.g. `"Bearer %s"`). |
| `apiKey.inject[].scheme` / `username` | string | Non-header presentation, e.g. `basic` with `username` (credential as password). |
| `oauth.tokenEndpoint` | object | `host` REQUIRED when `tokenEndpoint` is set. |
| `oauth.resourceHosts` | list\<string\> | API hosts where the bearer is used. |
| `oauth.sentinels` | object | The placeholder access/refresh tokens rendered in-container. |
| `oauth.credentialFile` | object | Renders sentinels into a file the agent reads. `structure` is a declarative nested map, encoded after substitution — output is well-formed regardless of values. |
| `oauth.credentialFile.format` | string | Encoding of the substituted structure: `json` (default) or `toml`, for agents that read TOML credential files. Nested maps become TOML tables. |
| `oauth.responseFields` | object | Maps a provider's nonstandard token-response field names: `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`. The refresh mapping also covers providers that reuse one field for both tokens. |
| `oauth.passthrough` | bool | Returns the real token to the container: a downgrade. |

`credentialFile.structure` leaf strings may reference `{{.AccessToken}}`
and `{{.RefreshToken}}` (strings), `{{.ExpiresAt}}` (a number),
`{{.Scopes}}` (an array), and `{{.PrimaryApiKey}}` (a string whose
enclosing key is omitted when no key is captured). Unknown placeholders are
errors. Each placeholder renders in the target encoding's own type.

## Runtime behavior

A conforming runtime:

- **MUST** resolve the credential from the host-side store keyed by <!-- tck: credential@1/resolved-from-host-store -->
  `service`. Host environment variables never auto-inject; a Kit cannot
  name where a secret lives, only what it needs.
- **MUST NOT** place the real secret in the container when `proxyManaged` <!-- tck: credential@1/secret-absent-in-sandbox -->
  or OAuth sentinels are in play: where the Kit names a variable or file,
  the container sees sentinel values there, and the boundary (proxy)
  substitutes the real credential on outbound requests matching the
  `inject` rules or `resourceHosts`.
- **MUST** intercept the OAuth `tokenEndpoint` and serve sentinel tokens, <!-- tck: credential@1/oauth-token-endpoint-intercepted -->
  refreshing host-side; `passthrough: true` is the explicit opt-out and a
  security downgrade a runtime MAY refuse.
- **MUST** scope by phase: an `install` credential is injectable only while <!-- tck: credential@1/phase-scoped -->
  install hooks run and is revoked before the workload's entrypoint starts;
  a `runtime` credential is the agent's steady state.
- **MUST** fail resolution when a **required** entry has no binding; an <!-- tck: credential@1/required-without-binding-fails -->
  **optional** entry with no binding is skipped and recorded, and the Kit
  runs unauthenticated.
- **SHOULD** set the `apiKey.name` env var to a sentinel (not empty) when <!-- tck: credential@1/sentinel-not-empty -->
  the credential is wired and the Kit names one, so Kit content can detect
  wiring without seeing the secret.
- **MUST** give an inject-only credential (no `name`) no environment <!-- tck: credential@1/inject-only-no-env -->
  presence at all: composing it adds no variable, sentinel or otherwise.

## Composition

Entries union across the set. Two Kits declaring the same (service, phase)
is a composition conflict — one credential, one owner.

## Gate

The service name is permission surface, per phase. A new service, or a
service moving between phases, widens.
